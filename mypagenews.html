<p>Hello :) My name is Amira Jones!</p>
<p>With this page, I would like to try to express myself by using photos, videos, and schedules/charts. I hope you get to learn a little bit more about me! </p>

<p> Fast Facts:</p>
<p>- I am a third year communications major and digital studies minor from San Francisco, California! I chose this field of study because it will allow me to be creative, teach me how to effectively communicate with others, and understand the role of social media and technology in society today. </p>
<p>- This is my first and probably last computer science course.</p>

</p> <b> <i>Why I chose Saint Mary's: </p> </b> </i>
<p>I chose to come to Saint Mary's for a few reasons. First, it was close to home. I am very close with my family and felt that it was important for me to stay close to home so I can go home whenever I wanted. Second, my cousin goes here and is a few years older than me, so I knew that there would be a familiar face around campus and I would not be alone. Third and finally, I chose Saint Mary's because it was a small school. I have only gone to small private schools and have done very well in that type of environment, so I felt that it would be too overwhelming to go to a bigger school. At Saint Mary's, I can form relationships with my teachers and peers easily which definitely helps my learning. I am glad I chose this school. I have made close bonds and relationships with people here which has made my college experience that much more enjoyable.</p>

</p> <b> <i>My Major & Minor + Why: </p> </b> </i>
<p>My major is communications. I wanted to be a communications major because I felt like it would help me achieve my career goals. I would like to get into social media management, public relations, or human resources. Communications majors learn about how to enhance their writing skills to get their foot in the door with journalism, public speaking courses that teach students how to give good presentations and speak with confidence, advertising and public relations courses to ensure students have a grasp of the different fields the communications world has to offer, and so much more! I am also a digital studies minor. With this minor, I am able to learn more about technologies evolutuion, how to program/code, and create digital media. While some of these courses are a bit challenging, I have been enjoying all of the new material that I am learnign and will use everythiing as tools to help me in my future career. </p>

<p> <b>My Favorite Spot On Campus Currently: </p> </b>
<p> One of the reasons why I like Saint Mary's is because the campus is super pretty! My favorite spot on campus would have to be my job at campus housing because it is on the ground floor of Augustine and I get to see so many of my friends running to and from class and they always will stop by to say hello to me! My other favorite spot on campus would also have to be </p>
